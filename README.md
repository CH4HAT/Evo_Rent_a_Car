The Evo class represents a shared car that can be rented by the hour. It is used to check whether a car is available, calculate the cost of a rental, and calculate how many kilometers the car has been driven in total. The car has two attributes: driver (a string, set to None by default) and distance (an integer, set to 0 by default).
