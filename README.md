.1   Created the Evo class. It represents a shared car that can be rented by the hour. It is used to:
          check if a car is available (= is a driver assigned? )
          calculate the cost of a rental (1 km = $1)
          calculate how many kilometers the car has been driven in total
     The car has the following attributes:
            1.driver (a string) - set to None by default
            2.distance (an integer) - set to 0 by default
